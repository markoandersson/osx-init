# Shell scripts to install clean development environment

See [init.sh](./init.sh) for installing required software with `homebrew`

See [antigen-setup](antigen-setup) for configuring [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) with [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Just include `antigen` configuration to your `.zshrc`.
